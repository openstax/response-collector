7669,143@1,"the protein is subject to changes in temperature, pH, or exposure to chemicals, the protein structure may change, losing its shape without losing its primary sequence in what is known as denaturation. Denaturation is often reversible because the primary structure of the polypeptide is conserved in the process if the denaturing agent is removed, allowing the protein to resume its function. Sometimes denaturation is irreversible, leading to loss of function. One example of irreversible protein denaturation is when an egg is fried. The albumin protein in the liquid egg white is denatured when placed in a hot pan. Not all proteins are denatured at high temperatures; for instance, bacteria that survive in hot springs have proteins that function at temperatures close to boiling. The stomach is also very acidic, has a low pH, and denatures proteins as part of the digestion process; however, the digestive enzymes of the stomach retain their activity under these conditions. Protein folding is critical to its function. It was originally thought that the proteins themselves were responsible for the folding process. Only recently was it found that often they receive assistance in the folding process from protein helpers known as chaperones (or chaperonins) that associate with the target protein during the folding process. They act by preventing aggregation of polypeptides that make up the complete protein structure, and they disassociate from the protein once the target protein is folded.",True

What did exist likely formed when solar radiation split airborne molecules of water (H2O) into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). Hydrogen, a lightweight gas, would have risen above the atmosphere and slowly been lost to space. The heavier oxygen gas, left behind, would have quickly reacted with atmospheric gases such as methane or with minerals on Earth'­s surface and been drawn out of the atmosphere and back into the crust and mantle. Oxygen could only begin to accumulate in the atmosphere if it was being produced faster than it was being removed'—in other words, if something else was also producing it.",True
9832,413@1,"n case (a), which is an exothermic reaction, the energy of the transition state is closer in energy to that of the reactant than that of the intermediate or the product. Therefore, from the postulate, the structure of the transition state also more closely resembles that of the reactant. In case (b), the energy of the transition state is close to neither the reactant nor the product, making none of them a good structural model for the transition state. Further information would be needed in order to predict the structure or characteristics of the transition state. Case (c) depicts the potential diagram for an endothermic reaction, in which, according to the postulate, the transition state should more closely resemble that of the intermediate or the product.

How can we explain the rate enhancement in terms of thermodynamics? To do so, we have to consider not the end points of the reaction but the chemical pathway between the end points. A chemical reaction of substrate S to form product P goes through a transition state S‡ that has a higher free energy than does either S or P. The double dagger denotes a thermodynamic property of the transition state. The transition state is the most seldom occupied species along the reaction pathway because it is the one with the highest free energy.

During aerobic respiration, oxygen (O2) reacts with sugar or glucose (C6H12O6), producing carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and energy (ATP). Thus, the chemical equation: C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + 2900 KJ (ATP) During anaerobic respiration, when there is not enough oxygen, cells break down glucose into lactic acid (C3H6O3) and energy (ATP).

33352,645@1,"Establishing the H+ gradient is a major function of the electron transport chain. The chain is an energy converter that uses the exergonic flow of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to pump H+ across the membrane, from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. The H+ has a tendency to move back across the membrane, diffusing down its gradient. And the ATP synthases are the only sites that provide a route through the membrane for H+. As described previously, the passage of H+ through ATP synthase uses the exergonic flow of H+ to drive the phosphorylation of ADP. Thus, the energy stored in an H+ gradient across a membrane couples the redox reactions of the electron transport chain to ATP synthesis, an example of chemiosmosis.",True

A single pathway can branch off toward different endpoints based on the interplay between two or more signaling pathways, and the same ligands are often used to initiate different signals in different cell types. This variation in response is due to differences in protein expression in different cell types. Another complicating element is signal integration of the pathways, in which signals from two or more different cell-surface receptors merge to activate the same response in the cell. This process can ensure that multiple external requirements are met before a cell commits to a specific response. The effects of extracellular signals can also be amplified by enzymatic cascades. At the initiation of the signal, a single ligand binds to a single receptor.

Another example of how characteristics of water are important to maintaining life is through its high heat capacity. Warm blooded animals can use water to transport heat from warm areas to cool areas in order to maintain homeostasis of body temperature. A third example is through evaporation.
